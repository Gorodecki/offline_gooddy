# Translate EN-RU from CSV file with FastAPI / Streamlit / Docker Compose

This project showcases the use of `FastAPI` and `Streamlit` in tandem.
The trained model is deployed using a FastAPI rest service containerized using `Docker`.
The front end UI is built on Streamlit which is hosted on its own Docker container.

We spin both the containers together using `Docker Compose` .
